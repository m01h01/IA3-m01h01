This repository is a part of CSI-246 at Renton Technical College.

## Independent Activity 3 - Deployment

For this project you will be deploying a React Application with user Authentication via Google. There are many different services which will allow you to host a React application. Remember that a React Application is a client side app only. This means that it can be deployed to any service which is able to serve a static web application. Every cloud server has a free option that will let you deploy a static web app. 

You may use your completed GA6 application as a starting point or any other React App you have created so far.

#### Requirements

Deploy a React app which uses OAuth to provide user login.
Change the appearance of the application based on whether a user is logged in or not.
Show the user profile info when a user is logged in.
Use Context to store the user information.
Share the User object with at least two components via Context (App.jsx counts as one, main.jsx does not).
Paste the link for your deployed application into the submission box for this assignment.

#### You do not need to spend any money to deploy a small project.
